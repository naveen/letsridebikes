let's ride bikes.

todo list:

- make link jump not just to venue but the specific tip added to their list
- only shows 500 friends
- can't get alphabetize sort to work on that assoc array (grr JS!)
- show things on a map
- show an add to 4sq button for the ones that i don't have in my list
- show city underneath venue (esp if it's in a city that you aren't currently in)
